        <h2>About LuXury CarSale</h2></br>
        <p>Just to introduce ourselves, briefly, we were the pioneers in initiating the business of importing European vehicles in the Auto Industry, which was far back in 1984 and began with the clever perception of the sole owner and the active Managing Director, Mr. Asitha to take this challenge to build a new market of introducing <strong>Brand New, Used and Recondition</strong> vehicles to Sri Lanka, where at that time our country was only familiar and monopolized with vehicles only of European models.</p>
                
        <p>Whilst carrying out this business during these years we also became successful in achieving a reasonable niche in the Sri Lankan economy by also importing auto parts to the country..</p></br>

        <p><b>In brief, we now have built up strong ties with the leading Car dealers in the European market which give us a clear advantage in marketing and meeting with our valued Customer’s needs for high quality European brand new and reconditioned cars, with a variety of models, at very attractive and competitive prices to fit in to your budget.</b></p>
