    <h2>Mercedes-Benz Design: Sensual Purity and Modern Luxury.</h2>
</br>
<p>Designers at Mercedes-Benz are reconciling tradition and modernity in
    designing the cars for the future. Their work centres on “Sensual Purity” as an
    expression of modern luxury. The new design idiom featuring reduced edges and
    creases – indentations and recesses in the sheet metal – aims to create clear
    forms and sensual surfaces which showcase high tech while also arousing
    emotions. Design creates something out of the ordinary and makes a major
    contribution to shaping the brand image. For Mercedes-Benz designers, good
    design has to be both beautiful and intelligent.</p>

                <p>The new A-Class is as youthful and dynamic as ever, but grown-up and
                    comfortable like never before. It completely redefines modern luxury in the
                    compact class, and revolutionises interior design. Technologically the new
                    A-Class not only takes first place thanks to MBUX – Mercedes-Benz User
                    Experience: it also offers a number of functions that were previously the

                </br>
                <p>The most successful model series from Mercedes-Benz is entering its fifth
                    year in production with extensive modifications. The design of the exterior and
                    interior benefits from a stylish makeover. The electronic architecture is
                    completely new and will make the user experience even more exciting. The new
                    C-Class features the latest Mercedes-Benz driving assistance systems offering
                    the driver cooperative support, and therefore provides a higher level of active
                    safety than its predecessor. The new C-Class also contributes crucially to the
                    electrification. As the first model, the C-Class benefits from the combination
                    of a diesel engine and an externally chargeable hybrid system.</p>

                <p>The design of the CLA underlines the coupé character with its stretched form
                    and design elements such as the bonnet with powerdomes or the rear licence plate
                    which has been moved down. As such it does justice to its predecessor’s status
                    as a design icon. The CLA has the very latest driving assistance systems with
                    cooperative driver support, and thus provides the highest level of active safety
                    in this segment with functions adopted from the S‑Class. Another example of
                    automotive intelligence and the transfer of technology from the luxury segment
                    to the compact class are the optional MULTIBEAM LED headlamps.</p>

                <p>The new CLS pioneers the new design idiom of Mercedes-Benz, which is
                    recognisable by its clear contours and reduced lines. Its character is marked by
                    a grille contour that widens towards the base and a forward-slanting front
                    section. Other features include wide, low-set headlamps and two-section tail
                    lights. At the same time the design reflects the timeless aura of the first CLS,
                    which founded a new segment and quickly became a design icon. Like its
                    predecessors, the new CLS exudes self-assured sportiness in exemplary style: a
                    highly emotive vehicle offering impressive long-distance and acoustic comfort

            <p>The GT is the second sports car developed entirely in-house by Mercedes-AMG.
                Its front mid-engine concept with transaxle and the intelligent aluminium
                lightweight construction form the basis for a highly dynamic driving experience.

                hallmark AMG driving performance. The new GT combines driving dynamics and
                first-class racetrack performance with superb everyday practicality, and
                efficiency that sets new standards in the segment. As another vehicle developed
                autonomously by Mercedes-AMG the new Mercedes-AMG GT 4-Door model delivers
                driving experiences in new dimensions and extends the AMG model family. The new
